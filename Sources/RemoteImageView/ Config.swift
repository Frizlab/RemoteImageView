	 Whether the default remote image view model cancels the image downloads if no remote image views are showing the URL being downloaded.
	 
	 When a remote image view is asked to show a given URL, it will ask its view model to load the given URL.
	 The view model will first check its cache, it the image is in it, it will return it directly.
	 If not, it will check the currently loading images.
	 If there is a loading operation for the given URL, it will await for its result and then return it.
	 If not, it will start the loading operation, await its result and return it.
	 
	 While the URL is loading, the image view can ask its view model to show a different URL.
	 
	 The `defaultRemoteImageViewModelCancelsImageDownloadsWhenNoRemoteImageNeedsIt` variable controls what happens
	 when all of the remote image view using the default view model cancels loading an URL (by asking to show another URL, or other).
	 
	 The default behaviour (variable set to `false`) will _not_ stop downloading the images, even if no remote image views are using it.
	 The rationale for this is:
	 - Starting a TCP connection is expensive;
	 - Another remote image view might need the URL later.
	 
	 So we keep loading the image and put it in the cache for a later use.
	 
	 When setting the variable to `true`, the loading will be cancelled as soon as no image view need the URL being loaded. */
